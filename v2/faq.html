					<h2>Describe the problem it's solving for whom.</h2>
					<p>The creative world is one of the most disorganized communities on the planet. The creative community makes our lives interesting; they create stuff that compels us to understand the world, make sense of events, and take action. Yet they often say that their careers are at the mercy of circumstantial opportunities and networks of people they just happen to know, rather than pro actively pushing their careers. <br /> <br />
					When you starting a new venture, you’re unplugging from the reward system that we’ve all grown up with it. Even if you already have an company and what to create a new product or invent something new, you are always in the risk, what people are most afraid of it. And instead spending millions on marketing research and creating the best solutions, we want to create a tool, where ideas are build by the people and for the people. Everyone can be part of it, the people with knowledge, dreams, passions, ideas, etc. Everything what they just need to do is to be the part of this process we are creating.</p>
